[global_config]

# Control how focus is given to terminals. 'click' means the focus only moves to a terminal after
# you click in it. 'sloppy' means the focus will follow the mouse pointer. 'system' means the focus
# will match that used by a GNOME window manager.
# Default value: click
focus = click
  
# Controls the width of the separator between terminals. Anything outside the range 0-5 (inclusive)
# will be ignored and use your default theme value.
# Default value: -1 
handle_size=-1

# If True the window will resize in step with font sizes, if False it will follow pixels
# Default value: True 
geometry_hinting=True

# When set to 'normal' the Terminator window opens normally. 'maximise' opens the window in a
# maximised state, 'fullscreen' in a fullscreen state and 'hidden' will make it not shown by default.
# Default value: normal 
window_state=maximized

# Controls whether the Terminator window will be started without window borders
# Default value: False 
borderless=False

# Defines where tabs are placed. Can be any of: top, left, right, bottom.
# Default value: top 
tab_position=top

# If set to True, tabs will have a close button on them.
# Default value: True 
close_button_on_tab=True

# If set to True, the tab bar will be hidden. This means there will be no visual indication of either
# how many tabs there are, or which one you are on. Be warned that this can be very confusing and
# hard to use.
# Default value: False 
hide_tabbar=False

# If set to True, the tab bar will not fill the width of the window. The titlebars of the tabs will
# only take as much space as is necessary for the text they contain. Except, that is, if the tabs no
# longer fit the width of the window - in that case scroll buttons will appear to move through the tabs.
# Default value: False 
scroll_tabbar=False

# If set to True, URL matching regexps will try to use POSIX style first, and fall back on GNU style
# on failure. If you are on Linux but URL matches don't work, try setting this to True. If you are
# not on Linux, but you get VTE warnings on startup saying "Error compiling regular expression", set
# this to False to silence them (they are otherwise harmless).
# Default value: False on Linux, True otherwise. 
try_posix_regexp=False

# Sets the colour of the text shown in the titlebar of the active terminal.
# Default value: '#FFFFFF'
title_transmit_fg_color=#FFFFFF

# Sets the colour of the background of the titlebar in the active terminal.
# Default value: '#C80003'

# Sets the colour of the text shown in the titlebar of any terminal that will receive input from
# the active terminal.
# Default value: '#FFFFFF'
title_receive_fg_color=#FFFFFF

# Sets the colour of the background of the titlebar of any terminal that will receive input from the
# active terminal.
# Default value: '#0076C9'
title_receive_bg_color=#0076C9

# Sets the colour of the text shown in the titlebar of any terminal that will not receive input from
# the active terminal. Default value: '#000000' 
title_inactive_fg_color=#000000

# Sets the colour of the background of the titlebar of any terminal that will not receive input from
# the active terminal. Default value: '#C0BEBF'
